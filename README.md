# GO-Agent---RL-AlphaBeta-Minimax
Built a 5*5 GO agent using RL and minimax tree as project in my AI class at USC. Used alpha beta pruning to reduce the branching factor. Minimax tree has dynamic depth of upto 6. Trained for 70k games against random and greedy agents, and got over 98% win rate against other agents.
